# Fast 4-Bit Adder (Lookahead Carry Adder) in Verilog

## Overview
A **Fast 4-bit Adder** is designed to perform high-speed addition by reducing the delay associated with carry propagation in a **Ripple Carry Adder (RCA)**. This is achieved using **carry lookahead logic**, which computes the carry signals in parallel rather than sequentially.

## Design Description
This Verilog module implements a **4-bit Fast Adder** using **carry lookahead logic** to optimize speed compared to conventional ripple carry adders.

### **Inputs:**
- **A** (4-bit): First operand.
- **B** (4-bit): Second operand.
- **c_in** (1-bit): Carry-in from the previous stage.

### **Outputs:**
- **sum** (4-bit): The resultant sum.
- **c_out** (1-bit): Carry-out from the most significant bit (MSB).

## Theory of Operation
The addition operation follows the binary sum formula:
\[
\text{sum}_i = A_i \oplus B_i \oplus C_i
\]

### **Carry Computation using Lookahead Carry Logic:**
Instead of propagating the carry bit sequentially, **carry lookahead logic** is used to precompute the carry bits:

\[
C_1 = (A_0 \cdot B_0) + ((A_0 \oplus B_0) \cdot C_0)
\]
\[
C_2 = (A_1 \cdot B_1) + ((A_1 \oplus B_1) \cdot C_1)
\]
\[
C_3 = (A_2 \cdot B_2) + ((A_2 \oplus B_2) \cdot C_2)
\]
\[
C_{\text{out}} = (A_3 \cdot B_3) + ((A_3 \oplus B_3) \cdot C_3)
\]

This approach allows **parallel computation of carry bits**, significantly reducing the overall propagation delay.

## Timing Analysis
The **critical path** (i.e., the longest delay) in an adder is the time taken for carry computation.

### **Delay Analysis**
Assuming **τ** is the delay of a basic logic gate:
- **Ripple Carry Adder Delay**: **O(N * τ)** (since carry propagates sequentially).
- **Lookahead Carry Adder Delay**: **O(log N * τ)** (since carry is computed in parallel).

For a **4-bit Fast Adder**:
- **Ripple Carry Delay** = `4 * τ`
- **Lookahead Carry Delay** = `log_2(4) * τ = 2 * τ`

Thus, the **Fast Adder** is approximately **twice as fast** as the Ripple Carry Adder for a 4-bit implementation.

## Conclusion
