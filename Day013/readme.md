# Binary Division Circuit Implementation

## Overview
This document explains a Verilog implementation of a 4-bit unsigned binary division circuit. The module takes two 4-bit inputs (dividend A and divisor B) and produces a 4-bit quotient Q and a 5-bit remainder R.

## Theory of Operation

### Non-Restoring Division Algorithm
The implemented circuit uses the non-restoring division algorithm, which is a sequential approach to binary division. This algorithm is particularly well-suited for hardware implementation because it can be executed using shifts and additions/subtractions.

### Basic Principles

1. **Initial Setup**: 
   - The algorithm begins by placing the dividend (A) in the least significant bits of a working register
   - The most significant bits of the register are initially set to 0
   - The register structure in this implementation is 9 bits total, with the upper 5 bits serving as the working remainder and the lower 4 bits accumulating the quotient

2. **Core Algorithm**:
   - For each bit position of the dividend (4 iterations for 4-bit inputs):
     - Left shift the entire register by 1 bit
     - Subtract the divisor (B) from the upper part of the register
     - If the result is negative:
         - Set the least significant bit of the register to 0
         - Add the divisor back to the upper part (restore)
     - If the result is non-negative:
         - Set the least significant bit of the register to 1
         - Keep the subtraction result

3. **Final Results**:
   - After all iterations, the quotient (Q) is found in the lower 4 bits of the register
   - The remainder (R) is found in the upper 5 bits of the register

### Special Case Handling
The implementation includes special handling for division by zero:
- When the divisor B equals 0, the quotient Q is set to 0 and the remainder R equals the dividend A
- This prevents errors that would occur in hardware when attempting division by zero

## Hardware Implementation Details

### Module Interface
- **Inputs**:
  - A[3:0]: 4-bit dividend
  - B[3:0]: 4-bit divisor
- **Outputs**:
  - Q[3:0]: 4-bit quotient
  - R[4:0]: 5-bit remainder (5 bits to accommodate potential larger values)

### Register Structure
The implementation uses a 9-bit register that serves multiple purposes:
- Bits [8:4]: Working remainder (5 bits)
- Bits [3:0]: Quotient bits (4 bits)

### Combinational Logic
The entire division operation is implemented in a single `always_comb` block, making it a purely combinational circuit with no clock dependencies. This means the division result is available as soon as the inputs are stable, without requiring multiple clock cycles.

## Example Operation

Consider dividing A = 13 (1101) by B = 3 (0011):

1. Initialize register = 0000_01101
2. Iteration 1:
   - Shift left: register = 0000_11010
   - Subtract B from upper bits: 00001 - 0011 = 11101 (negative)
   - Set bit 0 to 0, restore by adding B: 11101 + 0011 = 00000
   - Register = 0000_01010
3. Iteration 2:
   - Shift left: register = 0000_10100
   - Subtract B: 00001 - 0011 = 11110 (negative)
   - Set bit 0 to 0, restore by adding B
   - Register = 0000_10100
4. Iteration 3:
   - Shift left: register = 0001_01000
   - Subtract B: 00010 - 0011 = 11111 (negative)
   - Set bit 0 to 0, restore by adding B
   - Register = 0001_01000
5. Iteration 4:
   - Shift left: register = 0010_10000
   - Subtract B: 00101 - 0011 = 00010 (positive)
   - Set bit 0 to 1
   - Register = 0001_00001

Final result: Q = 0001 (4), R = 00001 (1)
Verification: 13 รท 3 = 4 remainder 1

## Applications
This type of division circuit is commonly used in various digital systems including:
- Arithmetic Logic Units (ALUs)
- Digital Signal Processing (DSP) applications
- Microprocessors and microcontrollers
- Various computational hardware

## Design Considerations
- The current implementation is purely combinational, which is simple but may not be optimal for timing in larger designs
- For higher performance, a sequential implementation with pipelining might be preferred
- The circuit handles 4-bit inputs, but the same algorithm can be extended to handle larger operands
